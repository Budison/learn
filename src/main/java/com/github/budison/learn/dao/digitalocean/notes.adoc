= DAO Design Pattern

- DAO stands for Data Access Object
- Used to separate the data persistence logic in a separate layer *(Separation of Logic)*
- The service remains completely in dark about how the low-level operations to access the database is done

== Components

1. The *model* which is transferred from one layer to the other -> `Book`

2. The *interface* which provide a flexible design -> `BookDAO`

3. The *interface implementation* which is a concrete implementation of the persistence logic -> `BookDAOImpl`

== Advantages of DAO pattern

1. While changing a persistence mechanism, service layer doesn’t even have to know where the data comes from. For example, if you’re thinking of shifting from using MySQL to MongoDB (in the example: shifting from List to Set), all changes are needed to be done in the DAO layer only.

2. DAO pattern emphasis on the low coupling between different components of an application. So, the View layer have no dependency on DAO layer and only Service layer depends on it, even that with the interfaces and not from concrete implementation.

3. As the persistence logic is completely separate, it is much easier to write Unit tests for individual components. For example, if you’re using JUnit and Mockito for testing frameworks, it will be easy to mock the individual components of your application.

4. As we work with interfaces in DAO pattern, it also emphasizes the style of “work with interfaces instead of implementation” which is an excellent OOP style of programming.
